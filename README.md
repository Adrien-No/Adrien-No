### Hi
Here you can find my solutions to some programming-exercices :
  * [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) : example with a solution of [day 19 of 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/19) with [beam search](https://github.com/Adrien-No/advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/j19_beam_search.ml)

  * [Prologin](https://prologin.org/) (french contest) : example with a [solution](https://github.com/Adrien-No/prologin-ocaml-solutions/blob/master/2022/qualifications/p5-coffre-fort.ml) of a [graph-problem](https://prologin.org/train/2022/qualification/coffre-fort)
  
  * [France-IOI](https://www.france-ioi.org/algo/chapters.php) : example with a [solution](https://github.com/Adrien-No/france-ioi-solutions/tree/main/niveau_4/0.1-installation_du_camping) of a classic [dynamic-programming problem](https://www.france-ioi.org/algo/task.php?idChapter=671&idTask=2329).  

I will also publish my "personal projects".

For now, here one I did years ago : [Blast Cone](https://github.com/Adrien-No/Blast-Cone)
